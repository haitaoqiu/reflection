lesson 1:

how does diff help coding?

makes comparison easy

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

you can go back to an older version easily;
you can verify the changes between 2 versions;
you can spot who made the changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

+: manual commit gives programmer total control over versions;
-: may loose some work between commits if computer fails;

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

git has repository; googledoc may not

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

use log to display history;
use diff to see changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

you can count on git to go back to older versions

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

it's cool. I will try to save files in the version controlled system
